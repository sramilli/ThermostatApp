/**
 * The {@code SPICompositeMessage} interface provides methods for constructing a
 * composite message. A composite message may be constituted of a sequence of read
 * and/or write operations to a single SPI slave device that will be performed as
 * a single transaction.
 * <p />
 * Here is an example of a composite message to a single slave: <blockquote>
 *
 * <pre>
 * try (SPIDevice slave = DeviceManager.open("SPI1", SPIDevice.class, null)) {
 *    ByteBuffer sndBuf1 = ByteBuffer.wrap(new byte[] {0x01});
 *    ByteBuffer sndBuf2 = ByteBuffer.wrap(new byte[] {0x02});
 *    ByteBuffer rcvBuf = ByteBuffer.wrap(new byte[3]);
 *    int bytesRead = slave.createCompositeMessage()
 *             .appendwrite(sndBuf1)
 *             .appendDelay(100)
 *             .appendwriteAndRead(sndBuf2, rcvBuf)
 *             .transfer()[2];
 * } catch (IOException ioe) {
 *     // Handle exception
 * }
 * </pre>
 * </blockquote> The preceding example is using a
 * <em>try-with-resources</em> statement; the
 * {@link SPIDevice#close SPIDevice.close} method is automatically invoked by
 * the platform at the end of the statement.
 *
 * @since 1.0.1
